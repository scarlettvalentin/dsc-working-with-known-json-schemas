    "## Introduction\n",
    "You've started taking a look at JSON files and you'll continue to explore how to navigate and traverse these files. One common use case of JSON files will be when you are connecting to various websites through their established APIs to retrieve data from them. With these, you are typically given a schema for how the data is structured and then will use this knowledge to retrieve pertinent information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the JSON module to load and parse JSON documents\n",
    "* Extract data using predefined JSON schemas\n",
    "* Convert JSON to a pandas DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading a JSON Schema\n",

    "In this lesson, you'll take a look at the response from the New York Times API. The general idea is that the New York Times makes some of its data available over the web, and it uses the JSON format to do so.\n",
